# Create Electron App

Create Electron apps with no build configuration.

Create React App works on macOS.<br>
If something doesn’t work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/pefish/create-electron-app/issues/new).

Base on react、electron、typescript、react-router、antd and mobx.

## Quick Overview

```sh
yarn global add create-electron-app
create-electron-app my-app
cd my-app
yarn start-client
yarn start-server
```

When you’re ready to deploy to production, just `yarn pack-mac`.

### Get Started Immediately

You **don’t** need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Just create a project, and you’re good to go.
